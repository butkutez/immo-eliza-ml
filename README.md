## Description

The real estate company Immo Eliza is looking to predict property prices in Belgium. This project develops a machine learning pipeline to preprocess a scraped real estate dataset and train multiple models to achieve the best price prediction performance.

This repository contains the complete ML solution, from data preprocessing techniques like imputation and one-hot encoding, through training and evaluation of baseline and advanced models, to a final, deployable prediction script.

## The Mission

To build a performant machine learning model to accurately predict the sale price of real estate properties in Belgium, utilizing a robust and reusable data processing and modeling pipeline.
